								An accident which had nearly been attended with fatal consequences occurred off the inner point of Mrs. Macquarie's Chair on Saturday afternoon. Mr. Mackay, of Darlinghurst, and Mr. Abercrombie, of the Glenmore Distillery, had been on board the ship Neptune, lying off Dawes' Battery, and were, at the time of the accident, returning to Mr. Mackay's residence, accompanied by Captain Nagle of the Neptune, in the ship's cutter, with four of the seamen.<br><br>
								
								<em>When off Mrs. Macquarie's Chair, at about 100 yards distance from the land, and in the act of tacking, a sudden gust of wind caught the sails and upset the cutter, and the whole of the people on board were precipitated into the water. Mr. Mackay, who is considerably advanced in years, and was at the time in a very indifferent state of health, made towards the shore, as did several of the younger and stronger of his companions. Before he could accomplish his object his strength failed him and he sank to the bottom, where he must have perished but for the prompt aid afforded him by Captain Nagle and two of the seamen who swam to his assistance and brought him safely, though senseless to shore. Mr. Abercrombie and two of the seamen saved themselves by clinging to the boat. - Sydney Gazette 16th January 1838</em></p><br>

				<h1>The Smallpox Epidemic</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>Smallpox has been one of humanity’s deadliest diseases, though it is now eradicated in the wild. Europeans, including the colonists who arrived in Sydney in 1788, had developed some resistance through earlier exposure to the disease. However the local Aboriginal people had not. There is still debate over how smallpox broke out in the Sydney area in 1789. Its impact on Aboriginal people across Australia was devastating.</p>

				<h1>The Castle Hill Rebellion</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>The Castle Hill Rebellion of 1804 was Australia’s first uprising. The rebellion was an attempt by a group of Irish convicts to overthrow British rule in New South Wales and return to Ireland where they could continue to fight for an Irish republic. Ending in disaster, the ill-fated rebellion resulted in the death of at least 39 convicts in both ‘Australia’s Battle of Vinegar Hill’ itself and ensuing martial law punishments.</p>

				<hr>
				<p>Early in the morning of 18 December 1838, seven men were publicly hanged at the Sydney Gaol. They were the first British subjects to be executed for massacring Aboriginal people. The Myall Creek massacre was neither the first nor last massacre of Aboriginal people in Australia but the NSW Supreme Court trials that followed set a judicial precedent. However, attitudes towards such massacres took longer to change.</p>

					Established in 1824 the penal settlement at Moreton Bay was a place of secondary punishment to house hardened criminals and recidivist prisoners.
					The Moreton Bay penal settlement was closed in 1842 when the Moreton Bay area was opened to free settlement, with Brisbane Town as its centre. The colony of Queensland was separated from New South Wales in 1859.

					On 26 January 1788 the first Governor of NSW, Captain Arthur Phillip, and the First Fleet arrived in Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) to establish a penal colony at Sydney Cove. 
					Many of the original accounts from the First Fleet mention the numerous ‘natives’ encountered in Botany Bay and Port Jackson from the first days of their arrival. Aboriginal peoples had been living in Australia for at least 40,000 years. The sea and woodland resources of the Sydney region — from the coast to the Blue Mountains in the west — supported a dense population of Aboriginal clans.
					In contrast, the British penal colony struggled in its first decades with lack of food — exacerbated by the failure of European farming practices on unfertile Australian soil — and a shortage of supplies.

					To early British settlers, Van Diemen's Land (as they called Tasmania) was the end of the world – an ideal location for some of their government's largest and most notorious penal colonies.
					The first Tasmanian jail was built at Risdon Cove in 1803, but in 1804 the prisoners were moved to Sullivans Cove – soon to be known as Hobart.
					After a decade or so, the Macquarie Harbour penal colony was established as a work house on Tasmania's west coast where convicts logged the Huon pine forests for ship building and furniture making. Renowned even among Britons at the time as a particularly harsh prison, it's remembered as the site of doomed escapes by convicts who drowned, starved or resorted to cannibalism in the surrounding bushland.

					The Swan River Colony marked a new chapter in Britain’s colonisation of Australia. The two main colonies of New South Wales and Van Dieman’s Land had at first been populated primarily by convicts. The Swan River Colony, founded in 1829, was to be something different, a colony for free settlers.
					During the first year of settlement the Swan River Colony struggled on a number of fronts. Initially too many people arrived too quickly, and then there were too few. Soon the population began to decline as disheartened settlers left for the eastern colonies.
					In 1847 the York Agricultural Society, a group of wealthy pastoralists, petitioned the colony’s Legislative Council to consider the introduction of convict labour. They argued that convict labour would stimulate the economy and open up the state to farming and development.

						Well I came out after a week… and was instantly punished for being "late to mass on a Sunday". 50 lashings I got, all for missing some old drone on about a man who died for our sins. Imagine that, dying for the sake of other people. Crazy. Anyway, the revolt was crushed within a week so I'm glad I missed that. The traitors were either killed or sent to a place they call Van Diamonds land. Wherever that is. As for us convicts, life goes on as normal… huh, funny how nothing noteworthy happened to me. I feel like in an alternate dimension, something much more interesting would have happened….

						Well, I tried to fight, I really did. I acted real brave I did, ran straight at then, ready to give them the old one, two. Or I would have run at them if they didn't graze my leg with a spear first. Luckily, my quick wits judged the situation and I decided that if I faked bawling my eyes out, they might think me pathetic and not a threat, even though I so clearly am. It succeeded, although it followed with a great deal of laughter and taunting form them which really hurt emotionally… or it would of if the crying and screaming had been real of course. After the rest of the crew they killed a bunch of others… not a pretty sight. Who would have thought people would react this violently while we invade and steal their land.

						Well it took a lot of acting, and I swear on my mother's grave, it was acting, an 'ard man like me could never weep so pathetically, they spared me, and allowed me to join their ranks. I think. I honestly haven't the foggiest at what they are saying, I've just been following them around and they haven't killed me yet. I was the only one they didn't kill in fact. It must have been my fine acting that saved me. Anyway, seems I'll be staying with them for a while.

						Phew, that was easy. Bill was obliterated completely, but then he lived a good, fulfilling life probably, being top-dog after all, while I was stuck as bottom dog, and I could never be top dog because I was 'incompetent' and 'a waste of air'… I'm not saying he deserved it but… he deserved it. Anyway, I managed to get back to camp in time to warn them and the guards routed them out before they could do too much more damage to the colony. Honestly though, what an unprovoked attack, what have we ever done to them apart from stealing their land and treating them like animals.

A fat lot of good I was though, sitting by while innocent people die and pretending that I had nothing to do with it. Anyway, best I get back to doing the only thing I'm good at… building bloody railroads.

							Well I told them, but they didn't do anything to stop, that’s for sure. They just waited for 'em to get back, charged 'em with escaping and hung 'em. Instead of preventing death, they just caused more. Goes to show what they care about aye. At least those poor people got some retribution though right? Not that it will do them any good. Looks like I'm destined to rot in this cell for the rest of eternity then, good for nothing but building railways. What fun…

							Right, it was a good choice, morally correct I would say. There was one small problem of course, which was that they don't speak English. I just waved my arms around for a bit, realised it wasn't working, then sat down and gave up. Luckily though, I put them on alert, so when those scum came out of the bushes ten minutes later, all guns blazing, they were filled with spears till they were as prickly hedgehogs. I threw like one rock at them, to show these people that I was on their side, and I think they believe me. They 'aven't killed me yet. Oh, and I just realised, I escaped. That was easier than I thought it would be. They really don't keep too close an eye on us convicts do they. Freedom, here I come.

						Well I managed to successfully steal the keys, using my stunning guile. I went to grab them and purposely tripped, grabbing the officers keys and his breeches with them. They…. Phew, they lashed me for that one. Luckily they didn't realise the keys were missing though. Anyway, that night I managed to get out the door, but some of the other convicts were still awake and threatened to call the guards if I didn't let them out as well… long story short, I ended up releasing half the prisoners before I could get away. Still, I'm out now. Time to go find myself some gold.

If you ever come across a random group of strangers, do not openly ask them where the nearest town is or tell them that you have pockets full of gold. I'm just saying, because, when that happened to me, they stole the gold, tied me up and left me out in the bush to die. I guess that I should 'ave expected that in a country full of convicts but… I'm just a trusting soul. Still, they gave me quite a hard hit on the head. Where does the sun rise again?
